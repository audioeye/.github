# .github

This is a magic GitHub repo that creates default versions of files that normally reside in <project>/.github. AE repos inherit files from here if they don't define their own versions. Examples include pull_request_template.md, code_of_conduct.md, and workflows. This repo must be marked Public in order to do its job.

## pull_request_template.md

## code_of_conduct.md
